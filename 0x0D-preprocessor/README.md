# C - Preprocessor
### The preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control.
 
## General:

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All files ends with a new line
* Code uses the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* Global variables are not allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* All header files are include guarded

### [Task 0](0-object_like_macro.h) - A header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024 with source file [0-main.c](0-main.c) and executable file [a](a)

### [Task 1](1-pi.h) - A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359 with source file [1-main.c](1-main.c) and executable file [b](b)

### [Task 2](2-main.c) - A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from with executable file [c](c)

### [Task 3](3-function_like_macro.h) - A function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x with source file [3-main.c](3-main.c) executable file [d](d)

### [Task 4](4-sum.h) - function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y with source file [4-main.c](4-main.c) executable file [e](e)
