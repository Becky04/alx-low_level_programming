# C - Preprocessor
 The preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control.
 
## General:

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All files ends with a new line
* Code uses the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* Global variables are not allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* All your header files should be include guarded
